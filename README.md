# School Evaluation SystemüìÑ‚úè
## **Description** üìë

***School Evaluation System*** is a program for institutional use that allows a teacher to formulate evaluations in the different courses he/she is in charge of.

This program allows a teacher to enter the system and then view two sections, evaluations and students. In the evaluations section you can enter the questionnaires, workshops or exams that you have formulated for a course and then you can edit or delete an evaluation. You can also import or export evaluations. In the students section, you can create a new course by entering its name or select from the list the course you want to enter and then you will have a visualization of the list of students of that course, as well as the options to edit the information of a selected student and create a new student. You will also be able to import or export the list of students.

üí° The idea of the ***School Evaluation System*** project was born from the need for a total transition to technology due to the change to virtuality in education. This project seeks to provide a tool to any teacher in their evaluation management with students.
